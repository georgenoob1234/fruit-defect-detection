## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-defect-detection.git
cd fruit-defect-detection
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download Pre-trained Models
The system requires two pre-trained models:
- Fruit detection model: `models/fruit_detection/fruit_detector.pt`
- Defect segmentation model: `models/defect_detection/defect_segmenter.pt`

These models can be trained using the provided training script or obtained through other means.

### 5. Set Up Configuration Files
Update the configuration files in the `config/` directory with your specific settings (see [Configuration](#configuration) section).

## Configuration

The system uses multiple YAML configuration files located in the `config/` directory:

### `config/model_config.yaml`
Configures the machine learning models:
```yaml
# Fruit Detection Model Settings
fruit_detection:
  model_path: "models/fruit_detection/fruit_detector.pt"
  confidence_threshold: 0.5
  target_classes:
    - apple
    - banana
    - tomato

# Defect Segmentation Model Settings
defect_detection:
  model_path: "models/defect_detection/defect_segmenter.pt"
  confidence_threshold: 0.6
  target_classes:
    - defective
    - non_defective
```

### `config/app_config.yaml`
Configures general application settings:
```yaml
# Logging Settings
logging:
 level: "INFO"
  file_path: "logs/app.log"

# GUI Settings
gui:
  show_gui: true
  show_defect_status: true

# Web API Settings
api:
  enabled: false
  base_url: "http://localhost:8000"
  endpoint: "/api/detections"
  timeout: 10

# Camera Settings
camera:
  source: 0
  width: 640
  height: 480
  fps: 30

# Photo Capture Settings
photo_capture:
  capture_defective_only: false
  image_save_path: "captured_images/"
  image_format: "jpg"

# Static Image Settings
static_image:
  enabled: false
  image_path: ""
```

### `config/telegram_config.yaml`
Configures Telegram bot integration:
```yaml
telegram:
  bot_token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
  enable_telegram: true
```

### `config/telegram_users.yaml`
Lists authorized Telegram user IDs:
```yaml
telegram_users:
  user_ids: 
    - 123456789
    - 987654321
```

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### Static Image Mode
To process a static image instead of camera feed:
1. Update `config/app_config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   static_image:
     enabled: true
     image_path: "/path/to/your/image.jpg"
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Keyboard Controls
- Press 'Q' to quit the application
- Close the GUI window to exit

### Telegram Bot Commands
- `/start` - Start interacting with the bot
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/adduser <username|user_id>` - Add a new user (admin only)
- `/showlogs [count]` - Show recent detection logs (admin only)

## API Integration

The system can send detection data to external web APIs. To enable API integration:

1. Update `config/app_config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   api:
     enabled: true
     base_url: "http://your-api-server.com"
     endpoint: "/api/detections"
     timeout: 10
   ```

2. The system sends JSON data in the following format:
   ```json
   {
     "fruit_class": "apple",
     "is_defective": true,
     "confidence": 0.85,
     "timestamp": "2023-12-01T10:30:45.123456",
     "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2]
   }
   ```

## Telegram Bot Integration

The system can send real-time notifications via Telegram. To set up:

1. Create a Telegram bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Update `config/telegram_config.yaml` with your bot token
3. Add authorized user IDs to `config/telegram_users.yaml`
4. Ensure users have started a chat with your bot by sending any message to it

When a defective fruit is detected, the system will send a notification with:
- Fruit type and defect status
- Confidence score
- Timestamp
- Image of the defective fruit

## GUI Interface

The system features a graphical user interface that displays:
- Live camera feed
- Bounding boxes around detected fruits (green for normal, red for defective)
- Defect segmentation overlays when defects are detected
- Confidence scores for each detection
- Overall detection statistics
- Application controls

The GUI can be enabled/disabled through the configuration file.

## Training Models

To train custom models for your specific use case, use the training script:

### Training Fruit Detection Model
```bash
python src/train_model.py --model_type fruit_detection --data_path /path/to/dataset.yaml --epochs 100
```

### Training Defect Segmentation Model
```bash
python src/train_model.py --model_type defect_segmentation --data_path /path/to/dataset.yaml --epochs 100
```

### Training with Custom Parameters
```bash
python src/train_model.py \
    --model_type fruit_detection \
    --data_path datasets/fruit_dataset.yaml \
    --epochs 200 \
    --img_size 384 \
    --batch_size 8 \
    --learning_rate 0.005
```

For detailed training instructions, see the [Training Documentation](docs/TRAINER.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
- Verify camera is properly connected and not being used by another application
- Check camera permissions on your system
- Try changing the camera source in `config/app_config.yaml` (try values like 0, 1, or '/dev/video0')

#### Model Loading Errors
- Ensure model files exist at the specified paths in `config/model_config.yaml`
- Verify model file integrity
- Check that PyTorch and Ultralytics are properly installed

#### Telegram Notifications Not Sending
- Verify the bot token is correct in `config/telegram_config.yaml`
- Ensure user IDs in `config/telegram_users.yaml` are correct
- Check that users have started a chat with the bot (send any message to it first)
- Verify the `enable_telegram` option is set to `true`

#### Low Detection Accuracy
- Try adjusting confidence thresholds in `config/model_config.yaml`
- Consider retraining models with more diverse dataset
- Ensure proper lighting conditions during detection

#### High CPU Usage
- Reduce camera resolution in `config/app_config.yaml`
- Lower camera FPS in `config/app_config.yaml`
- Consider using GPU acceleration if available

### Performance Optimization
- Use GPU acceleration when available
- Optimize camera resolution and FPS settings
- Adjust model input size in model configuration
- Consider using lighter model variants for real-time applications
